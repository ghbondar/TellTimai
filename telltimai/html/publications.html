                            >The Archaeology of Egypt in the Third Intermediate Period</a>, by James Bennett,<br/>Cambridge University Press, 2019</h4>
                        <p>The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1076–664 BCE) has been characterised previously by political and social changes based upon the introduction of Libyan social and cultural influences. In this book, James Bennett analyses the concepts of 'transition' and 'continuity' within the cultural and societal environment of Egypt during the Third Intermediate Period and provides an up-to-date synthesis of current research on the settlement archaeology of the period. This is done through the assessment of settlement patterns and their development, the built environment of the settlements, and their associated material culture. Through this analysis, Bennett identifies several interconnected themes within the culture and society of the Twenty-First to Twenty-Fifth Dynasties. They are closely related to the political and economic powers of different regions, the nucleation of settlements and people, self-sufficiency at a collective and individual level, defence, both physical and spiritual, regionality in terms of settlement development and material culture, and elite emulation through everyday objects.</p>

                                at Tell el-Timai, Egypt</a>, by Nicholas Hudson, Liesel Gentelli
                            &amp; Joshua Trampier,<br />in Journal of Field Archaeology, 43:1,
                            2018</h4>
                        <p>Archaeological evidence of ceramic production most commonly consists of
                            locally procured raw materials. Excavations at Tell el-Timai in Lower
                            Egypt recovered raw fine marl clay from two transport jars in the
                            vicinity of pottery kilns dating to the 4th century B.C. Production
                            wasters of small perfume bottles produced in the same fine marl clay
                            were found inside the kilns. The marl clay inside the jars pointed to an
                            origin outside of Lower Egypt. Samples of the clay and wasters, along
                            with a confirmed locally sourced sample, were subjected to X-Ray
                            Fluourescence (XRF) analysis, revealing significant differences in their
                            chemical compositions. The results of the analysis are compared to
                            published Egyptian data and an Upper Egyptian provenience is suggested
                            because the raw clay is consistent with available comparative XRF
                            data.</p>

                        <p>In this chapter we focus on the period of Greek rule in Egypt and the
                            influence of Hellenism from Alexander’s conquest of Egypt in 332 B.C.E.
                            to the death of Cleopatra VII, the last Ptolemaic pharaoh, in 30 B.C.E.
                            We attempt to discern some of the particulars of the imposition of
                            imperial authority and the transition to a Greek model of administration
                            represented in the documents and archaeology of Thmuis as opposed to the
                            temple complex rule of adjacent Mendes. The most recent archaeological
                            discoveries from the city of Thmuis in the eastern Nile Delta offer a
                            new perspective on the process of Hellenism and the agency of the
                            Egyptian people and priests in the complex milieu of colonialism,
                            assimilation, exploitation, and resistance.</p>

                        <p>This article presents three assemblages of pottery from the northern spur

                            so, some preliminary observations on the broader context of Tell Timai

                            Science: Reports, 2016</h4>
                        <p>A circular structure was excavated in a suspected industrial area of
                            ancient Thmuis (Tell Timai), and due to heavy vitrification and
                            discolouration of the inside walls, was suspected to be a glass furnace.
                            The excavated furnace provides a unique example to further understand
                            the mechanisms of primary and secondary glass manufacture in Roman
                            Egypt. Samples were subjected to a number of archaeometric
                            investigations in order to characterise the furnace, and identify its
                            purpose. Following attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
                            infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope energy
                            dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), we conclude that the furnace was used
                            for glass. We propose that it is most likely that the furnace represents
                            a small-scale, secondary glassmaking centre, shaping glass manufactured
                            at Wadi el-Natrun, and recycling glass objects from the local area.</p>

                        <p>Large deposits of domestic pottery from primary contexts in Ptolemaic
                            Lower Egypt are uncommon and seldom presented in their entirety. is
                            article presents four primary deposits from the destruction level of a
                            late third/early second-century structure at Tell el-Timai in the Nile
                            Delta (ancient muis). e architectural setting for the deposits is
                            presented, followed by presentations of each deposit in its entirety,
                            organized by functional classications. Analyses of the deposits are
                            then used to suggest behavioral possibilities, with particular attention
                            to bread baking and drinking activities. is is followed by a discussion
                            of the nature of the total assemblage within the context of Egyptian
                            pottery studies and an explication of how the assemblage can be
                            understood as part of the broader region of the Levant during the
                            Hellenistic period.</p>

                        <p>Excavations by the University of Hawaii at the Greco-Roman City of Thmuis
                            in 2011 unearthed a group of fragmentary acrobat terracotta figurines in
                            a votive pit located up on the central portion of the tell in grid
                            square R-13 in the heart of the ancient city. Examination of the
                            terracottas and the material from within the pit showed that these
                            figurines dated to the Late Hellenistic Period or the Early Roman
                            Period. They were subsequently ritually deposited in a pit within an
                            abandoned structure around the second half of the 1st Century A.D. The
                            acrobats are modelled in classical Greek style and form part of the
                            genre of figurines and scenes representing Africans that were popular in
                            Egypt during the Greco-Roman Period. These terracotta figurines are the
                            first example of this terracotta mould series to be found in Egypt
                            depicting this pose.</p>

                        <p>For several years now, we have been studying the process of mudbrick
                            making in our excavation at Tell Timai. Our site is in the village of
                            Timai El Amdid in the Nile Delta, which still has many mudbrick
                            structures, some of them collapsing. We hired a traditional mudbrick
                            maker from the village to help us. He is a member of a dying profession.
                            With his help during the summer of 2013, amidst the turmoil of what was
                            then being called the Arab Spring, we were making mudbricks using
                            ancient methods.</p>

                        <p>This paper describes salvage work in Unit O7-15 conducted during the 2011
                            field season and the subsequent analysis of recovered assemblages during
                            2012. A collection of seven in situ circular ceramic ovens, and a midden
                            of bone and shell remains, allowed for the examination of the diet of
                            the people of ancient Thmuis, and the Nile Delta.. Ceramic and
                            numismatic evidence dates these features to the first century BCE, with
                            perhaps some crossover into the first century CE.</p>

                            kilograms of pottery, much of it well-preserved, likely represents
                            activities at the site from the very end of the Persian period and hints
