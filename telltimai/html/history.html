        <h1>History of the Ancient City of Thmuis</h1>
        <main>
            <p>The ruins of the Greco-Roman Egyptian city of Thmuis are found at <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thmuis/@30.798766,30.4813305,189171m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x14f7841254e495a1:0x6c8ce4be9c61a249!2sThmuis!3b1!8m2!3d30.9397222!4d31.5172222!3m4!1s0x14f7841254e495a1:0x6c8ce4be9c61a249!8m2!3d30.9397222!4d31.5172222"
                    >Tell-El Timai in the Nile Delta of Egypt</a> near the modern city of
                El-Mansoura. Thmuis is first mentioned in Classical texts by Herodotus (<a
                    href="http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Hdt.%202.166"
                    >Histories of Herodotus 2.166</a>) based on his visit in the middle of the 5th
                century BCE. By Ptolemaic times the city was flourishing, having assumed
                administration of the Mendesian nome from its sister city at nearby Mendes.
                Historical references to the city in Josephus (<a
                    href="https://lexundria.com/j_bj/4.659/wst">Jewish Wars 4.659</a>), Pliny
                (Natural History 13.2.4), Ammianus Marcellinus (<a
                    href="https://archive.org/details/L315AmmianusMarcellinusRomanHistoryII2026/page/n303"
                    >Roman History 22.16</a>) and other sources attest to the importance of the city
                in the Classical world. The city earned its greatest fame as the source of <a
                    href="https://topostext.org/work/153">Mendesian perfume</a> which was prized
                throughout the Mediterranean, and Thmuis played an important role in the rise of early
                Christianity, serving as an episcopal see during the Late Roman Period (3rd - 4th
                centuries CE). The city appears to have been abandoned during the Arab Period in 831
                CE following the suppression of a tax revolt.</p>
