                <p>The ruins of the Greco-Roman Egyptian city of Thmuis are found at Tell-El Timai
                    in the Nile Delta of Egypt near the modern city of El-Mansoura. Thmuis is first
                    mentioned in Classical texts by Herodotus (Histories of Herodotus 2.166) based
                    on his visit in the middle of the 5th century BCE. By Ptolemaic times the city
                    was flourishing, having assumed administration of the Mendesian nome from its
                    sister city at nearby Mendes. Historical references to the city in Josephus
                    (Jewish Wars 4.656), Pliny (Natural History 13.2.4), Ammianus Marcellinus (Roman
                    History 22.16) and other sources attest to the importance of the city in the
                    Classical world. The city earned its greatest fame as the source of Mendesian
                    perfume which was prized throughout the Mediterranean. The city played an
                    important role in the rise of early Christianity, serving as an episcopal see
                    during the Late Roman Period (3rd - 4th centuries CE). The city appears to have
                    been 2 abandoned during the Arab Period in 831 CE following the suppression of a
                    tax revolt.</p>
