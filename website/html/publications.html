                        2017</h4>
                    <p>In this chapter we focus on the period of Greek rule in Egypt and the
                        influence of Hellenism from Alexander’s conquest of Egypt in 332 B.C.E. to
                        the death of Cleopatra VII, the last Ptolemaic pharaoh, in 30 B.C.E. We
                        attempt to discern some of the particulars of the imposition of imperial
                        authority and the transition to a Greek model of administration represented
                        in the documents and archaeology of Thmuis as opposed to the temple complex
                        rule of adjacent Mendes. The most recent archaeological discoveries from the
                        city of Thmuis in the eastern Nile Delta offer a new perspective on the
                        process of Hellenism and the agency of the Egyptian people and priests in
                        the complex milieu of colonialism, assimilation, exploitation, and
                        resistance.</p></div>

                        Review, 2014</h4>
                    <p>For several years now, we have been studying the process of mudbrick making
                        in our excavation at Tell Timai. Our site is in the village of Timai El
                        Amdid in the Nile Delta, which still has many mudbrick structures, some of
                        them collapsing. We hired a traditional mudbrick maker from the village to
                        help us. He is a member of a dying profession. With his help during the
                        summer of 2013, amidst the turmoil of what was then being called the Arab
                        Spring, we were making mudbricks using ancient methods.</p></div>
