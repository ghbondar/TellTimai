        <h1>About the Tell Timai Archaeological Project</h1>
        <div id="container">
            <div id="content">
                <p>Tell Timai, the ancient city of Thmuis, is a rare example of a well-preserved
                    Graeco-Roman City in the Nile Delta. The urban center is nearly complete and
                    offers an exceptional opportunity to study all aspects of life, business,
                    religion, and administration during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. Mudbrick
                    architecture is rarely preserved in the Delta, making Tell Timai a unique piece
                    of Egyptian history. Unfortunately the site is under considerable threat from
                    encroachment, erosion, and looting. The Tell Timai Project of the University of
                    Hawaii has embraced the concepts of Research, Conservation, and Education and has
                    undertaken the tasks of studying the city to save it as an important piece of
                    Egyptian patrimony and world history. The ultimate goal is to create a site
                    worthy of drawing tourism to the Eastern Delta and combining the site with
                    neighboring Mendes to create a World Heritage Archaeological Zone.</p>
                <p>The ambitious goals of the Tell Timai Project are beyond the means of any one
                    institution. We have a philosophy that this work will only be successful if it
                    is a cooperative effort between international scholars and institutions,
                    Egyptian archaeological institutions, the Ministry of State Antiquities/Supreme
                    Council of Antiquities, and the people who live in the vicinity of the Tell
                    Timai-Mendes Archaeological Zone.</p>
